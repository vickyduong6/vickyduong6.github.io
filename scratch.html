    <h3>Description of the game</h3>
    <p>A game where it tests your knowledge and wit of the community of La Quinta High School.</p>
    
       <h4>Describe some programming concepts or structures you learned in this unit that you applied in your game.
</h4>
    <p>We have learned te concept of algorithems  which are step by step procedures that gives directions on what our sprite has to do.
    We also used if-else statements to describe if an action doesn't occur, this must happen</p>
    
    <h5> What aspects of your game did you like best?</h5>
    <p>I liked how it related to everyone in the class, and how one needed to be clever in order to answer the
    questions or solve the riddles.</p>
    
      <h6>If more time was given for you to work on your game, what would you improve or modify about your game?
</h6>
    <p>I would of added more "mini games" to increase the user's entertainment. I also would of incorporated more lives so people have the chance to see all the questions; a lot of
    people for frustrated with having 10 questions but only having 2 lives.</p>
